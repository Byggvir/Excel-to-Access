Connecting Excel spreed sheet with VBA-scripts to an Access DB

## Demo for data transfer between MS Excel and MS Access

You can import or link MS Access tables and queries into MS Excel spreedsheets with simple onboard tools. But these tools do not allow to set parameters in the query. Do pass parameters to queries you have to use VBA scripts.

This is a collection of more or less useful examples.
