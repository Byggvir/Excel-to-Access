# Excel-to-Access
Connecting Excel spreed sheet with VBA-scripts to an Access DB

## Demo for data transfer between MS Excel and MS Access

You can import or link MS Access tables and queries into MS Excel spreedsheets with simple onboard tools. But these tools do not allow to set parameters in the query. Do pass parameters to queries you have to use VBA scripts.

This is a collection of more or less useful examples.

## Files

In DB/Datenbanken.7z you will find a test database _Spielwiese.accdb_ and the spreasheet _Spielwiese.xslm_.


An VBA class for accessing Access databases is in _AccessDB.cls_ ready for import.

The files _InsertQueryForm.frm_ and _InsertQueryForm.frx_ contain a userform and _RibbonButtons.bas_ contains macros to call the sub routines from a RibbonButton.
